# A collection of Cucumber tests for lorekeeper

DO NOT RUN THESE ON YOUR LIVE SITE. They will create a bunch of random data that you probably don't want.

A small suite of Gherkin/Cucumber tests to run after making updates, to hopefully catch bugs early.

To run:
- Install node.js with your favorite method: https://nodejs.org/en

Install packages
